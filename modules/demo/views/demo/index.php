<h2>Demo Your Module</h2>

<p><em>This is default description page. If add a description for this demo, create a new view in <tt>views/<?php echo HTML::chars($api) ?>/index<?php echo HTML::chars(EXT) ?></tt>.</em></p>

<p>Having good documentation is great, but so are good examples. The <a href="http://github.com/shadowhand/demo">demo module</a> by <a href="http://shadowhand.me/">shadowhand</a> lets module authors write demos that can be viewed and executed in the browser, no copying and pasting required! In fact, you are looking at the demo module right now.</p>

<p>Each demo within a module is contained in a separate method. The source code of each demo will be included at the bottom of the screen. When exceptions occur, they will be displayed.</p>
